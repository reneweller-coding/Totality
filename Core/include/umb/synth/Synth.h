/**
 * @file Synth.h
 * @brief The mono synth (PLAN 5.3): the bass in the SH-101 idiom and the 303 line, one voice each, one parameter table.
 *
 * Signal path, at twice the sample rate where anything is nonlinear:
 * @code
 *   PolyBLEP saw..pulse + square sub an octave down -> tanh drive -> circuit filter (Filters.h, Ephemeris' models)
 *   -> half-band decimator -> high pass (Low Cut) -> low pass (High Cut) -> amp envelope -> duck -> level, pan
 * @endcode
 * **The filter** is one of Ephemeris' circuit models, solved sample by sample: the Juno's IR3109 cascade by default
 * (the SH-101 has the same chip), the diode ladder for the 303 line. Its cutoff is Cutoff times 2^(Env Amount x env) times
 * the key tracking, the envelope an exponential Decay retriggered by every note that does not slide.
 *
 * **Accent** (the 303's): an accented note opens the envelope further (Accent times an octave and a half) and plays
 * louder (Accent times 4 dB). **Slide**: the note after a slid one does not retrigger either envelope and glides to its
 * pitch in Glide ms (or 60 ms when Glide is 0); a plain Glide above 0 glides every note (portamento).
 *
 * **Low end** (PLAN 5.2): where the rumble owns the band under the split, the engine raises the voice's Low Cut to at
 * least 100 Hz, so the bass carries its harmonics above the kick's fundamental and never its own fundamental under it.
