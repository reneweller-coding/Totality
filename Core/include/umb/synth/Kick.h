/**
 * @file Kick.h
 * @brief The kick (PLAN 5.1): three engines with closed-form phase, a 909 top layer, the kick's EQ, and the phase the
 *        rumble and the sub continue.
 *
 * **Sweep engine** (Phosphene). A sine chirp y(t) = A(t) sin(2 pi phi(t)). The frequency falls from a start to an end
 * pitch along two exponential segments -- a fast punch segment (tau_1) and a slower body segment (tau_2):
 *
 *   f(t)   = f_e + (f_s - f_e) ((1 - p) e^(-t/tau_2) + p e^(-t/tau_1))
 *   phi(t) = f_e t + (f_s - f_e) ((1 - p) tau_2 (1 - e^(-t/tau_2)) + p tau_1 (1 - e^(-t/tau_1)))
 *
 * phi is the exact integral of f, evaluated in closed form at every sample; a kick that should have started 0.37
 * samples before the grid begins at t = 0.37 / fs. Amplitude: linear attack, hold, exponential decay.
 *
 * **Resonator engine** (Phosphene). A damped rotating phasor whose amplitude does not depend on its tuning, so the
 * same pitch envelope sweeps it; a trigger adds energy to the ring instead of restarting it, which is how the
 * TR-808's bridged-T bass drum behaves (Werner, Abel and Smith, DAFx 2014).
 *
 * **909 engine** (Umbra). The TR-909's bass drum is a swept oscillator whose wave a shaper turns almost into a sine,
 * with filtered noise and a click beside it (Reid, Synth Secrets 34). Here: the sweep's closed-form phase drives a
 * triangle, tri(phi) = 1 - 4 |frac(phi + 1/4) - 1/2|, whose fundamental is in phase with sin(2 pi phi) (its series is
 * 8/pi^2 sum (-1)^k sin((2k+1) 2 pi phi)/(2k+1)^2), so the phase lock and the rumble's continuation hold unchanged;
 * the saturator after it rounds the corners, more with more drive. The odd harmonics a triangle carries (-12 dB per
 * octave) are what the ear reads as the 909's knock.
 *
 * **The top layer** (the Berghain recipe, Dok. 3: a second kick, a 909 pitched eight semitones down, high-passed at
 * 400 Hz, under the body). Its own sweep with the body's time constants, shifted by Top Pitch, a triangle through its
 * own drive, a fourth-order high pass at Top Cut, its own short decay. It lives above the rumble's split and plays no
 * part in any phase relation.
 *
 * **The EQ** (Dok. 8.4): a second-order high pass at Low Cut (a subsonic filter; the body's fundamental sits a little
 * over an octave above it) and a peaking dip at Dip Freq. Both are in chainPhase(), because the rumble's sub and the
 * sub bass sum with the kick *after* them.
 *
 * **Output phase.** outputPhaseAt() returns the phase of the kick as it leaves the module at time t: phi(t) plus the
 * phase responses of the chain at the instantaneous frequency -- half a sample for the first-order ADAA saturator, the
 * tone low pass, the DC blocker, the low cut, the dip. asymptoticPhase() is the constant c with outputPhase(t) ->
 * f_e t + c: the phase a sine at f_e must have to continue the kick's tail exactly (the rumble's sub, PLAN 5.2).
 *
 * **Latching.** Every trigger freezes the pitch and amplitude settings for that kick; a parameter ramp acts on the
 * next kick, never inside one.
 *
 * @note Adapted from Phosphene `Core/include/phos/Kick.h` at 76f7100 (27.09.2026): the sweep and resonator engines,
 *       the phase trim, the tail limit and the click are Phosphene's; the 909 engine, the top layer, the EQ, the
 *       tuning rules and asymptoticPhase() are Umbra's.
