/**
 * @file SetFile.h
 * @brief Curation and the `.umbset` file (PLAN 7.8, 9): a track or a set as seed, settings and rerolls.
 *
 * The composer writes every part of a track on its own stream (Composer.h): the form, the harmony, the rack, the
 * layers, the blocks' candidates, the events, the hands, the sounds; the set composer its order, tempo and blends
 * (Set.h). **Rerolling** one of them draws it again and leaves every other bit for bit as it was -- the user curates
 * instead of programming. A reroll is a counter per unit that moves the unit's stream: `form`, `harmony`, `rack`,
 * `layers`, `blocks`, `events`, `hands`, `sounds`; a single layer's patterns as `rack.<layer>` ("rack.clap"); a single
 * block's candidate as `block<n>` (1-based); in a set the same prefixed with the track (`track3.events`) plus `set`
 * for the order, the styles and the keys. What is not rerolled is locked (PLAN 7.8: a locked layer keeps its matrix
 * while the block around it is drawn again).
 *
 * The `.umbset` is text in the style of Ephemeris' `.ephset`:
 * @code
 *   # Umbra set
 *   seed=11
 *   minutes=7
 *   set=120
 *   reroll track3.events=1
 *   param compose.style=Ostgut
 * @endcode
 * Only the parameters that differ from their defaults are written.
 *
 * @note Copied from Ephemeris `Core/include/eph/SetFile.h` (namespace eph, prefix EPH_) at d047d79 (27.09.2026).
