/**
 * @file Midi.h
 * @brief Standard MIDI File export of a score (PLAN 9).
 *
 * Format 1, 960 ticks per quarter note. Track 0 is the conductor track: name, 4/4, key signature, the tempo map, the
 * markers and the form's operations (as markers "op: add open hat"). Every part with notes gets its own track: the
 * kick and the kit's lanes on channel 10 with their General MIDI notes, so a DAW's drum rack recognises them, one
 * track per lane so each can be muted; the sub on channel 1, the ping 2, the bass 3, the 303 line 4, the chord 5, the
 * drone 6, the texture 7 (a note per bar where it plays).
 *
 * Tempo ramps are written as one tempo event per beat whose value makes that beat last exactly as long as it does in
 * the ramp (Phosphene's and Ephemeris' rule). Automation, when the parameters are given, goes on a track "controls",
 * channel 16: every automated knob a controller number from 20 on, in the order of the parameter ids, its value
 * 0..127 every thirty-second note while it moves.
 *
 * @note The encoder is copied from Ephemeris `Core/src/Midi.cpp` at d047d79 (27.09.2026); parts and controllers are
 *       Umbra's.
