/**
 * @file Loudness.h
 * @brief What a mix measures (the production guide's 9.1, 9.2 and 6.5): loudness after EBU R128 and ITU-R
 *        BS.1770-4, true peak, the dynamic figures PSR and PLR, and the stereo image's correlation and width.
 *
 * - **Loudness**: K-weighting (the two BS.1770 filters, designed for the sample rate), mean squares over
 *   400 ms blocks every 100 ms; the integrated loudness gated absolutely at -70 LUFS and relatively 10 LU
 *   under the mean of what passed; the short-term loudness over 3 s; the loudness range (EBU Tech 3342)
 *   from the 10th to the 95th centile of the short-term values gated at -70 LUFS and 20 LU under their mean.
 * - **True peak**: the 8x interpolator of Dynamics.h; a window whose samples cannot reach the running
 *   maximum is skipped, which is exact (TruePeakInterpolator::gainBound).
 * - **PSR** (peak to short-term loudness ratio): the true peak within the loudest 3 s against their
 *   loudness; under 8 the guide calls a master crushed. **PLR**: the true peak against the integrated.
 * - **Stereo**: the correlation of left and right over the whole and its lowest one-second value (the
 *   guide: between 0 and +1, never below 0 for longer than a second), and how far the side lies under the mid.
 *
 * Offline: the meter keeps every 100 ms hop (a few hundred kilobytes an hour) and computes its report at the end.
