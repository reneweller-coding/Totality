 * @file Dynamics.h
 * @brief The master's dynamics: a log-domain bus compressor, an 8x interpolated true-peak estimate and
 *        a lookahead true-peak limiter.
 *
 * **Bus compressor** after Giannoulis, Massberg and Reiss, "Digital dynamic range compressor design --
 * a tutorial and analysis" (JAES 60(6), 2012): feed-forward, the gain computer in the log domain with a
 * quadratic soft knee (their eq. 4), and the smooth decoupled peak detector placed after the gain
 * computer (eq. 17 on the gain reduction), which they recommend for its artefact-free release and
 * because attack and release then act on decibels, not on the waveform. The two channels share one
 * detector (the larger of the two), so the stereo image does not move.
 *
 * **True peak.** A signal's peak between the samples can lie several decibels above its largest sample
 * -- a sine at a quarter of the sampling rate sampled at 45 degrees reads 3 dB low, and at 0.45 of the
 * sampling rate a crest that falls midway between two samples reads 16 dB low. Nielsen and Lund,
 * "0 dBFS+ Levels in Digital Mastering" (AES 109th Convention, 2000), are why the ceiling is set on
 * this quantity and not on the largest sample. The estimate follows the method of ITU-R BS.1770-4
 * Annex 2 -- interpolate a grid of points between the samples and take the largest -- with a filter
 * bank of our own rather than the standard's table: seven points between every pair of samples (8x),
 * each from a Kaiser-windowed sinc of twenty-four taps.
 *
 * *Why these numbers, and why the previous ones were wrong* (measured 16.09.2026, docs/PLAN.md). This
 * is a fractional-delay filter bank, not an interpolating low-pass, and for a fractional-delay filter
 * evaluated at a single point only the **passband** deviation |H(f)| - 1 over 0 .. 0.5 fs is an error:
 * the input is already band-limited, so there is no image for a stopband to suppress (Laakso,
 * Valimaki, Karjalainen and Laine, "Splitting the unit delay", IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 13(1),
 * 1996, section on windowed-sinc designs). The old bank spent its length on a stopband it did not
 * need: a Kaiser window of beta = 8 buys about 80 dB of attenuation above Nyquist and pays for it with
 * a transition band so wide that |H| was already 1.3 dB down at 0.40 fs and 5.6 dB down at 0.45 fs.
 * With beta = 4 and twenty-four taps the same bank is flat to within 0.14 dB over 0 .. 0.45 fs. The
 * grid was the other half: three points per sample can miss a crest by cos(pi f / 4), which is 0.44 dB
 * at 0.40 fs, so eight points (cos(pi f / 8), 0.14 dB at 0.45 fs) are the matching choice. The two
 * together read a crest placed anywhere between two samples, up to 0.45 fs, within 0.15 dB, against
 * 4.2 dB for the old bank; on an eight-minute render the reported true peak rose by 1.30 dB.
 *
 * Above 0.45 fs (21.6 kHz at 48 kHz) no claim is made and none is affordable: reconstructing a crest
 * there needs hundreds of taps per phase, because the sine's own samples carry almost none of its
 * amplitude. The normalisation is unity at DC, which is a no-op here -- the taps of every phase sum to
 * 1.000000000 before it is applied -- and is kept only so that a future window cannot change the DC
 * gain silently.
 *
 * **Limiter.** For every sample the gain that keeps its true peak at the ceiling is computed; a
 * sliding minimum over the lookahead window followed by a moving average of the same length gives a
 * gain that has fully arrived when the peak does -- each average contains the peak's own required
 * gain, and every value in it is at most that -- and moves smoothly, without overshoot; the recovery
 * afterwards is exponential. The audio is delayed by the window (plus the interpolator's half length),
 * which the engine reports as its latency.
