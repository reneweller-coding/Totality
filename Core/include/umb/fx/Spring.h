/**
 * @file Spring.h
 * @brief The spring reverb (PLAN 5.8), fed from the echo's send as in a tape echo with springs.
 *
 * A spring does not scatter sound like a room; it carries it as a dispersive wave: the low frequencies
 * of a transient arrive later than the highs, so every reflection is a falling chirp -- the "boing".
 * After Välimäki, Parker and Abel ("Parametric spring reverberation effect", JAES 58(7/8), 2010): a
 * cascade of first-order all-passes produces the chirp and sits in a feedback loop with the spring's
 * transit delay, a low pass (a spring passes little above 5 kHz) and a high pass. Two springs of
 * different lengths, one per side, as in the tanks of the time.
 *
 * The tape echoes of the seventies that players of this music used had springs built in; here the
 * spring takes the echo's send, so a row sent to the echo is also sent to the spring.
