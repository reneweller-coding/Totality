/**
 * @file Clock.h
 * @brief Musical time: note divisions and the tempo map of a set.
 *
 * A psytrance set moves within a few BPM, often rising slowly, and a change of style profile ramps
 * the tempo over 16 to 32 bars. The tempo map is a list of points in beats; between two points the
 * tempo is either held or ramped linearly *in beats*. Time in seconds is the integral of 60/bpm over
 * the beats, which for a linear ramp has a closed form, so beats and seconds convert exactly in both
 * directions without accumulating error over a three-hour set.
 *
 * @note SyncDiv copied from Noctuary `Core/include/ambient/Clock.h` at b60a2fe (15.09.2026); the
 *       tempo map is new.
 * @note Copied from Phosphene `Core/include/phos/Clock.h` at 9a2f615 (24.09.2026); namespace eph, prefix EPH_.
 * @note Copied from Ephemeris `Core/include/eph/Clock.h` at d047d79 (27.09.2026); namespace tot, prefix TOT_.
