 * @file Oversample.h
 * @brief Oversampling by linear-phase half-band stages: four times around a memoryless nonlinearity,
 *        two times around a stereo circuit.
 *
 * A saturation, a clipper or a wavefolder makes partials the sample rate cannot hold, and they fold
 * back below Nyquist as tones in no harmonic relation to anything -- the "digital grey" the
 * production guide warns about (25.09.2026, section 3: 4x on everything nonlinear). The cure is to
 * run the curve at four times the rate, where the new partials have room, and to filter them away
 * before coming back down.
 *
 * Two half-band stages of two times each, rather than one of four: the first carries the steep
 * transition around the original Nyquist frequency (51 taps, 80 dB, pass band to 0.8 of Nyquist),
 * the second only has to separate the images a whole octave apart (19 taps). A half-band filter
 * has every second tap at zero and its centre at one half, so each stage costs one multiply per
 * non-zero tap on one polyphase branch and a plain delay on the other. Both are Kaiser-windowed
 * sincs normalised to unity gain at DC, designed once in the constructor -- not on the audio
 * thread, and not as a static a first call would have to build under a lock.
 *
 * The price is latency: 29.5 samples at the base rate, about 0.6 ms at 48 kHz. Every place that
 * uses it is either the whole signal (the master, the Patina, the feedback loop, the air ahead of
 * the far hall) or the whole of one voice after its filters, so nothing is summed against an
 * undelayed copy of itself -- with one exception the voice documents (the filter's parallel mode).
 *
 * One Oversampler4 is one mono channel; a stereo stage owns two. StereoOversampler2 (26.09.2026) is
 * the first stage alone for both channels at once, for the voice filter's circuit models: they are
 * filters with memory rather than a curve, their own stages low-pass what their saturation makes,
 * and they are dear enough that twice the rate is what Ephemeris runs them at too. Its latency is
 * 25 samples.
 *
 * **Cost** (26.09.2026). The taps' sums are the stages' whole work. They are vector sums now (AVX2,
 * NEON, or four scalar accumulators), which adds the same products in a different order: the result
 * moves in the last bit or two. A vector sum over a history that has just been written stalls,
 * though -- a wide load cannot be served from the narrow store still on its way to the cache, and
 * the first attempt, over the doubled rings the stages used to keep, came out twice as slow as the
 * scalar sums it replaced. So each history is now a Line: the newest sample is multiplied on its
 * own, the vector sum reads only samples written a call or more ago, and the line runs down a
 * buffer and jumps back to its top every 64 samples instead of wrapping.
 *
 * @note Copied from Noctuary `Core/include/ambient/Oversample.h` at 7a48fdd (27.09.2026); namespace tot. One change:
 *       dot() is the four-accumulator scalar sum on every path, so the desktop and the Quest compute the same bits (the
 *       vector sums of Noctuary's Simd.h would move the last bit between paths). Totality uses the oversampler on the
 *       kick's shaper, the rumble's clip and the master's clipper -- a few channels, where the scalar sum costs
 *       about ninety multiply-adds a sample.
