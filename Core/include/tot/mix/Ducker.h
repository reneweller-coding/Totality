/**
 * @file Ducker.h
 * @brief Event-driven sidechain ducking.
 *
 * The kick's triggers are known from the score, so ducking does not need to listen to the kick's
 * audio: the gain curve starts on the trigger, sample-accurate and deterministic, with no detector
 * lag and no dependence on the kick's level. The curve is attack (linear, from wherever it is),
 * hold, and a raised-cosine release back to unity -- continuous in value everywhere, and in slope
 * at both ends of the release.
 * @note Copied from Phosphene `Core/include/phos/Ducker.h` at 76f7100 (27.09.2026); namespace tot. Added: amount(), the
 *       curve itself, which the rumble uses to gate its sub (Rumble.h).
