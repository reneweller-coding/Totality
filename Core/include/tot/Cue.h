/**
 * @file Cue.h
 * @brief Score cues for a visualiser (PLAN 10.3): what the score knows, sent over OSC at the moment it is heard.
 *
 * Kaleidoscope guesses beat and section from the audio it is fed. Totality does not have to guess: it wrote the score.
 * So it says so, over UDP as OSC 1.0:
 * @code
 *   /tot/beat i f      beat number, tempo in BPM                         on every beat
 *   /tot/bar i         bar number                                         on every bar
 *   /tot/block s       the block's name ("Intro", "Block 3", "Reduction", "Return", "Outro", a set's track)   at its start
 *   /tot/op s          the form's operation ("add ride", "remove chord", "kick out")                         where it acts
 *   /tot/key s         the track's key as a Camelot label ("8A")                                            where a track begins
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Where a cue comes from** (after Phosphene's and Ephemeris' Cue.h): not from the composer but from the play position.
 * The engine's score becomes a list of marks when it is loaded (cueMarksOf); the audio thread gives CueTap::scan() the
 * beat range each block covers, and the tap stamps every mark in it with the instant the listener hears it.
 *
 * **The audio thread sends nothing.** scan() does arithmetic and one wait-free push per cue into a CueRing; the
 * CueSender's own thread pops, waits for the due instant and calls sendto(). **Failure is silence.**
 *
 * @note Copied from Ephemeris `Core/include/eph/Cue.h` (namespace eph, prefix EPH_) at d047d79 (27.09.2026); the
 *       messages are Totality's.
