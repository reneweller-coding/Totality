 * @file Oscillator.h
 * @brief Band-limited virtual-analogue oscillator: PolyBLEP saw blended into a pulse.
 *
 * A naive sawtooth has a discontinuity every period whose partials fold back above Nyquist as
 * inharmonic tones. PolyBLEP subtracts a two-sample polynomial approximation of the band-limited
 * step residual at every discontinuity (Valimaki and Huovilainen, "Antialiasing oscillators in
 * subtractive synthesis", IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 24(2), 2007). Run at twice the sample
 * rate and decimated through a half-band filter, as the bass does, the remaining aliasing below
 * 18 kHz lies near -57 dB (measured in the self test).
 *
 * **Phase convention.** The oscillator is addressed by the phase of its *fundamental*, as a sine:
 * phase 0 means the fundamental is at an upward zero crossing. The rising ramp 2t - 1 has the
 * Fourier series -(2/pi) sum sin(2 pi k t)/k, so its fundamental is sin(2 pi (t - 1/2)): the ramp
 * position is the fundamental phase plus one half. At that point the ramp itself is zero.
 *
 * **Pulse polarity.** A pulse that is +1 for t < w has the fundamental +(4/pi) sin(2 pi t) at w = 1/2,
 * which is opposite in sign to the ramp's. Blending the two therefore cancelled the fundamental: at
 * Wave = 1/3 it vanished completely. The pulse is inverted (-1 for t < w) so both fundamentals share
 * one phase and the blend moves the timbre without taking the note away.
