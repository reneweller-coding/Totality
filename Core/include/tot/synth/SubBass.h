/**
 * @file SubBass.h
 * @brief The sub bass (PLAN 5.3): a sine that starts every note in the kick's phase, under a duck from the kick.
 *
 * In a track whose low end the sub owns (compose.low_owner = Sub, the Dub profile's default), the rumble loses its
 * sine and this voice plays the bass line's fundamental: a sine, never below 35 Hz, low-passed at 80 to 120 Hz, mono
 * (Dok. 8.4). The kick's tail and the sub overlap in the first sixteenths after every kick, and there they must add.
 *
 * **Kick lock.** The engine hands every note the kick's phase at the note's ideal start -- f_k t + c, from
 * Kick::asymptoticPhase() -- and the note starts at r times it, r = f_note / f_k. For a note at the kick's pitch (the
 * tonic under a tonic kick, the most common case) the two are then one sine; for its octaves the zero crossings meet
 * at the start; for other intervals only the start is aligned, which is all a phase can do.
 *
 * **Duck** event-driven (Ducker.h): 6 to 12 dB, a short hold, a raised-cosine return of 150 to 350 ms (Dok. 8.7).
 * **Envelope:** Dsp.h's ADSR with the sub-sample onset of Phosphene; the release never shorter than half a period
 * (Phosphene's release floor), so a note's end does not click.
