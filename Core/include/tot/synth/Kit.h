/**
 * @file Kit.h
 * @brief The percussion kit (PLAN 5.4): twelve lanes of Phosphene's universal percussion voice (PercKernel.h), each
 *        with its own output, and the 909's metal table as a noise source.
 *
 * The kit turns lane parameters into kernel coefficients, starts hits (with sub-sample onsets, pitch shifts, chokes
 * and clap bursts) and renders the lanes in registers: two AVX2 registers or three NEON registers for the twelve
 * lanes. Everything that is not a per-sample operation on all lanes -- noise generation, the metal table, burst
 * schedules, triggers -- is scalar and shared by every vector path.
 *
 * **Lane outputs** (Totality). Phosphene summed the lanes; here every lane's stereo output stays readable after
 * processLanes(), so the engine can route the hats and the percussion to buses of their own (the perc bus's low pass
 * is a ramp target, PLAN 7.3) and send single lanes to the dub delay later.
 *
 * **The 909's metal table** (Totality, PLAN 5.4). The TR-909's hats and cymbals are six-bit samples of real cymbals,
 * played through an analogue VCA and filter, with a tuning range of 0.43 to 1.7 times (Dok. 3). Totality samples nothing:
 * the table is made in prepare() from a fixed seed -- 60 inharmonic partials, log-uniform between 2.8 and 17 kHz, each
 * with its own decay of a quarter to one and a quarter seconds, a little decaying white noise under them -- normalised
 * and quantised to 64 levels, the six bits that give the 909 its grit. A lane with Noise Type = 909 Metal reads it
 * instead of white noise, from its start at every hit, at Metal Scale times its own rate (48 kHz), linearly
 * interpolated; the lane's noise envelope is the 909's VCA and its filter the 909's filter.
 *
 * **Tuning.** A lane with Tune to Key moves its pitch to the nearest note of the current key and scale.
 *
 * **The auto-pan** (Phosphene, 16.09.2026): each lane swings around its position with a period of three sixteenths,
 * the two phase groups by role; see Phosphene's Perc.h for the algebra that keeps the kit's width.
 *
 * @note Adapted from Phosphene `Core/include/phos/Perc.h` and `Core/src/Perc.cpp` at 76f7100 (27.09.2026): roles,
 *       lane outputs and the metal table are Totality's; the coefficients, triggers and the kernel are Phosphene's.
