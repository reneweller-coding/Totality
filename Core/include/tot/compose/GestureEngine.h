/**
 * @file GestureEngine.h
 * @brief The player's hands (PLAN 7.3): what moves the knobs, when, how far and how fast.
 *
 * Two hands, each a process in time: it takes a knob, moves it along a curve to a new place, lets go, rests, takes the
 * next. The rules that make it sound like a person:
 * - **Never more than two hands**, and never both on the same knob.
 * - **Continuity**: a movement starts where the knob was left, so no value ever jumps.
 * - **Human shape**: most movements follow the minimum-jerk profile of a reach (Flash and Hogan 1985); some start
 *   slowly, a few are quick twists that settle; a knob that throws (an echo's feedback) is thrown and caught.
 * - **The energy** of the moment (0..1) sets where a knob tends to go; around that centre the target scatters.
 *
 * **The grid** (Totality, PLAN 7.3: "Kurven auf 4/16/32-Takt-Rastern verankert"): with HandStyle::gridBeats a movement
 * starts on a line of the grid counted from @c start and lasts a whole number of grid cells, so a filter ride of the
 * form begins with a phrase and ends with one. The techno defaults move slowly: a median of 16 bars, rests of about as
 * long -- the meso level of Dok. 8.5's table (ramps of 16 to 32 bars), the micro level being the composer's own events.
 *
 * @note Copied from Ephemeris `Core/include/eph/compose/GestureEngine.h` (namespace eph, prefix EPH_) at d047d79
 *       (27.09.2026); the grid and the techno timing added.
