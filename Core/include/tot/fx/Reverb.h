 * @file Reverb.h
 * @brief Eight-line feedback delay network reverb for the send buses (room and hall).
 *
 * Each channel passes its own pre-delay and a four-stage Schroeder all-pass diffusion into four of the
 * eight lines, and reads those same four back (Reverb.cpp, kLeft); a Householder reflection mixes all
 * eight. The four are not the first half or the second: the line set is ordered by length, so that
 * split handed one channel every short line and the other every long one and the two returns came out
 * with different colours (16.09.2026: 1.45 dB rms between the third octaves 500 Hz .. 8 kHz in the
 * room, 1.36 in the hall, worst band 2.55). Interleaved so that each channel holds two short lines and
 * two long ones, the returns are as decorrelated as before -- they share no line -- and now differ by
 * 0.65 and 0.53 dB rms.
 * Every line carries a short all-pass inside its loop, which scatters each echo into many so the echo
 * density grows quickly (Schlecht and Habets, "Scattering in feedback delay networks", IEEE/ACM TASLP
 * 2020), and the line lengths are the set Noctuary's optimiser found for the flattest third-octave
 * magnitude of the tail (after the colourless-FDN work of Dal Santo, Prawda, Schlecht and Valimaki).
 * Each line's gain gives the decay time exactly: g = 10^(-3 L / (T60 fs)). A one-pole low pass in every
 * loop darkens the tail; a high cut and a 12 dB/octave low cut sit on the return.
 *
 * **Depth rule.** The return's low cut never goes below 150 Hz: a tail under 140 Hz would smear
 * exactly the band where kick and bass are phase-locked.
 *
 * @note Adapted from Noctuary `Core/include/ambient/Effects.h` (class Reverb) at b60a2fe (15.09.2026):
 *       the network, diffusion, scattering, line lengths, damping and return filters are unchanged; the
 *       freeze, the rotating-matrix mode and the classic line set are left behind, the pre-delay is set
 *       in samples by the caller (so it can follow the tempo), and the output is wet only.
 *
 * **The gate (20.09.2026, round "reverb", A2-gated-reverb.md).** The user's rule: a big hall that is
 * ducked while the synths play and cut hard at the bar change, as an option per voice/bus. Two stages,
 * both multiplicative on the wet return and independent of each other:
 *  - setDuck()/processDucked(): an envelope follower on the *send itself* (self-sidechain, the classic
 *    gated-reverb trick) pulls the return down while the feed is loud and lets it back up as the feed's
 *    own envelope falls quiet -- no note events are needed, so this class stays self-contained and the
 *    result reacts to whatever the caller actually sent, stutters and level automation included.
 *  - barGate(): stateless, a function of the absolute beat alone (same idea as TranceGate::open): open
 *    through the bar, a fast raised-cosine close from the bar line, a hold at the floor, a fast reopen.
 *    Being a pure function of `beat`, a bar rendered alone closes at the same instant as the same bar
 *    inside a whole set -- the host's block size decides nothing. It is `static` and returns a plain
 *    gain because, unlike the duck, it needs the tempo (beats per sample) to reach the caller's absolute
 *    beat grid, which only Engine.cpp's send routing knows; Engine.cpp multiplies it onto this class's
 *    gated output.
