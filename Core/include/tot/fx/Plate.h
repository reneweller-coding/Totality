/**
 * @file Plate.h
 * @brief A plate reverb (PLAN 5.8, a room of its own beside the hall): Dattorro's figure-eight tank.
 *
 * After J. Dattorro, "Effect Design, Part 1: Reverberator and Other Filters", JAES 45(9), 1997, the
 * plate-class reverberator in the style of Griesinger: a band limit and a pre-delay, four input diffusers
 * (all-passes of 142, 107, 379 and 277 samples at 29761 Hz), then a tank of two halves that feed each other --
 * each a modulated all-pass (672 and 908 samples, 16 samples of excursion), a delay, a damping low pass, the
 * decay gain, a second all-pass and a second delay. The output is the sum of fourteen taps inside the tank,
 * seven per side, as the paper's table gives them. All lengths are scaled from 29761 Hz to the sample rate.
 *
 * A plate is denser and brighter than the hall and has no early reflections of a room: the sound of the
 * EMT 140 on a seventies record. The decay time is turned into the tank's gain: a round through both halves
 * takes 0.716 s and passes the gain four times, so gain = 0.001^(0.179 / T60).
