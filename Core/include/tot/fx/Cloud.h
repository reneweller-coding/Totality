/**
 * @file Cloud.h
 * @brief The granular cloud (PLAN 5.7): grains of the ping's and the chord's recent past, for the soundscapes of the
 *        reductions (Rodhad, Dok. 3).
 *
 * A history of the last five seconds of what the ping and the chord send into it; grains read out of it -- a Poisson
 * stream of Density a second, each Size ms long (0.7 .. 1.3 of it), starting up to Spray seconds back, at the pitch it was
 * played or, with the chance Pitch, an octave down (0.4), an octave up (0.3) or a fifth up (0.3), under a Hann window,
 * panned across the field. Its output goes into the plate as well as into the mix, so the grains sit in a room.
 *
 * Noctuary's GrainCloud (Core/include/ambient/Cloud.h at 7a48fdd) is the model, not the source: its Aetherizer half --
 * the feedback spiral through a spectral shifter, the resonators on the scale, the Hawkes swarm -- serves a far plane
 * that Totality does not have, and it needs the tuning system and the FFT shifter with it. What a reduction wants is the
 * plain cloud, written anew here in a tenth of the lines.
 *
 * Every decision is per sample (the onsets from one stream, the grains in a fixed pool), so the host's blocks change no
 * bit; with Level at -60 dB no grain starts, and once the last has ended the pool is skipped.
