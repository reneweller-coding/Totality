/**
 * @file TapeEcho.h
 * @brief The tape echo (PLAN 5.8): a delay whose head wanders, whose loop saturates and loses its top.
 *
 * In this music the echo is part of the composition: an eighth-note sequence into an echo of a dotted
 * eighth becomes an interlocking sixteenth pattern (PLAN 2.4), and the feedback thrown up at the end of
 * a phrase is a gesture of its own.
 *
 * **Model.** After the tape delays of Arnardottir, Abel and Smith ("A digital model of the Echoplex tape
 * delay", AES 125, 2008) in the parts that matter to the ear, not in circuit detail:
 * - the playback head reads the tape at a delay that wanders: *wow* as a slow sine near 0.7 Hz plus a
 *   slower random drift, *flutter* as a small fast sine near 9 Hz, both in milliseconds of delay;
 * - the loop runs through a low pass (the tape's and the head's loss of highs, so every repeat is darker
 *   than the one before), a high pass at 70 Hz (no build-up of rumble) and a tanh saturation, so a
 *   feedback above one does not explode but settles into the self-oscillation a player uses as an
 *   effect;
 * - a change of time glides, as the tape speed does, and so it bends the pitch of what is in the loop.
 * Reading is by four-point Hermite interpolation. Ping-pong feeds each side's loop into the other.
 *
 * Deterministic: the drift has its own stream, seeded once.
