/**
 * @file NoteTap.h
 * @brief The notes the decks played in one process() call, for the plugin's MIDI out (02.10.2026).
 *
 * A deck writes every composer note it actually plays into the tap -- after the performer's mutes and the keyboard's
 * Replace and composer switch, so MIDI out is what is heard -- with its absolute sample; the plugin turns them into
 * MIDI events on the channels of the MIDI export (Midi.h, midiChannelOf). A note whose part has no note-off of its own
 * carries the sample its off is due (the kick, the kit and the ping: 50 ms after the on). A played key is not written: it came in as MIDI already.
 * Fixed capacity, no allocation: the audio thread fills it and the same thread empties it.
