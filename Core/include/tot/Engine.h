/**
 * @file Engine.h
 * @brief The engine: three decks (Deck.h), the DJ mixer and the master (PLAN 3, 7.7, 8).
 *
 * @code
 *   deck A -+-> fader -> isolator (200 Hz / 2.5 kHz, a kill each) -> filter -+-> sum -> mono under Mono Below -> level
 *   deck B -+                                                          ...   +-> fx send -> tempo echo + hall -> sum
 *   deck C -+   (a track alone plays on deck A, without isolator and filter)          -> [vinyl cut] -> clip at 4x -> limiter
 * @endcode
 * **Time** is the sample counter; beats are derived from it through the tempo map (Clock.h), never accumulated. A set's
 * decks share its tempo map.
 *
 * **Determinism across block sizes** (the rule of all three siblings). Parameters and automation are read on an
 * absolute raster of 32 samples and at the samples a deck's score steps its mixer channel (a kill, a bass swap: the
 * outgoing deck's low band closes and the incoming one's opens in the same sample), and spans are split exactly at note
 * events and where a deck starts or stops resting, so a host's block size cannot change a single sample (the self test
 * renders with blocks of 1, 37 and 512 and compares bits, with one deck and with two).
 *
 * **Loading** allocates and must not run on the audio thread (as in Ephemeris).
