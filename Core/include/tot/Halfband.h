/**
 * @file Halfband.h
 * @brief Polyphase IIR half-band filters for 2x oversampling, as lane templates.
 *
 * Two parallel chains of first-order all-pass sections in z^-2 whose outputs are averaged form a
 * half-band low pass with an elliptic-like response: very steep, a few samples of group delay at low
 * frequencies, and only two multiplies per coefficient per sample. The phase is not linear near
 * Nyquist, which does not matter for a bass or an acid line.
 *
 * The coefficients are designed at run time from a stopband attenuation and a transition width
 * (designHalfband()), using the closed-form design of Valenzuela and Constantinides, "Digital signal
 * processing schemes for efficient interpolation and decimation", IEE Proc. G, 1983, in the
 * formulation of Laurent de Soras' HIIR library.
