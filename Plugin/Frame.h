/**
 * @file Frame.h
 * @brief The frame the generators share (01.10.2026): one way of working all of them, and a skin of its own for each.
 *
 * The user (01.10.2026): the generators should be unified "damit potentielle Nutzer nicht soviel umlernen müssen --
 * allerdings nur, wenn es nicht auf Kosten der Übersichtlichkeit geht", each with a style of its own, and the headset's
 * gestures offered only when a Quest is there or asked for. What is the same everywhere lives here:
 *
 * - **the look and feel** of every control, drawn from a Skin: the knob with the live ring (where a value plays away
 *   from where it stands), the fader, the switch, the menu, the tabs;
 * - **the header**: logo and name, style, key, scale, the choice of a single piece or a set and its length, Compose,
 *   New seed, Play and Mute in the first row; the ratings, the status and the curation, then undo, redo, help and the
 *   settings in the second (layoutHeader);
 * - **the backdrop**, the skin's picture: strong behind the header, faint behind the pages, switchable;
 * - **the settings** (one per instrument, not per project): the update check, the backdrop, the headset, the window's
 *   size, full screen, the keys and the version;
 * - **the keys**: Space play and stop, Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y undo and redo, F1 help, F11 full screen, Esc back, Ctrl+S save,
 *   Ctrl+O open, Ctrl+E export;
 * - **the help**: the manual's prose by topic, with topics an editor makes on the spot (its tab's parameters);
 * - **undo** (UndoHistory), **sub-tabs** (SubTabs), the **controls** with their right-click menu (MIDI learn, forget,
 *   default; Knob, Choice, Switch) and the **live rings** (LiveRings);
 * - **the headset** (Headset): the hands of a Meta Quest arriving as OSC from the instrument's Quest app (bridge mode),
 *   and the grammar every app shares -- left pinch play and stop, both hands pinched the next one, right pinch the
 *   genre's action (held: its second), left hand's height the master filter, right hand's the echo throw.
 *
 * Nothing here knows an engine: an editor hands its processor's functions in.
 *
 * @note Identical in Ephemeris, Totality, Parhelion and Phosphene (Plugin/Frame.h and Frame.cpp), and Noctuary uses its
 *       settings, keys and headset parts: a change is made in all of them.
