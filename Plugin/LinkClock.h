/**
 * @file LinkClock.h
 * @brief Ableton Link for the standalone (02.10.2026, the family's): tempo, beat phase and start/stop shared with the
 *        other apps on the network -- DJ software, Ableton Live, another generator of the family.
 *
 * Off by default (Settings > Ableton Link). On, the standalone joins the Link session. With other apps in it, it follows
 * the session as it follows a host's playhead in a DAW: the session's tempo, its bar phase (a quantum of four beats --
 * the bars line up, the position in the track stays), its start and stop. Alone in the session it leads: the session
 * takes the track's tempo. In a DAW the host's transport rules and Link is not used. Ableton Link is free software
 * (GPL-2.0-or-later, github.com/Ableton/link), compiled in through cmake/Family.cmake (family_link).
 *
 * For tests and diagnostics: FAMILY_LINK=1 switches it on without touching the settings, FAMILY_LINK_REPORT=<file>
 * appends a line a second with what the session says (tick()).
