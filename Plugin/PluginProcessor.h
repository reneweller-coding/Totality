/**
 * @file PluginProcessor.h
 * @brief The plugin (PLAN 10.1, 12; Phase 5): the engine, the composer on a thread of its own, transport, the performer.
 *
 * **Parameters.** Every entry of the engine's ParamStore is a host parameter (StoreParameter, after Phosphene's and
 * Ephemeris'): the store is the only place a value lives, read and written as a relaxed atomic, so a knob in the plugin
 * and the same knob in tot_render stand at the same place.
 *
 * **Composing.** "Compose" snapshots the parameters, the seed and the rerolls and hands them to the composer thread: a
 * track (composeTrack) or, with set.minutes above zero, a set (composeSet). The finished score waits until the message
 * thread loads it into the engine with processing suspended -- the engine allocates when it loads, and the audio thread
 * never does. Its loudness is measured afterwards on the same thread while it already plays (Leveler.h), and the
 * corrections glide in.
 *
 * **Time.** In a host the playhead is the clock: the engine follows its position in beats and jumps when the host does,
 * at the host's tempo -- the score is loaded with the host's tempo as a constant (forPlayback, PLAN 16.2: "im Host gilt
 * das Host-Tempo"), and a new host tempo loads it again on the message thread from the beat it was at. A set's own tempo
 * drift is the standalone's and the export's. The standalone has its own play and stop.
 *
 * **Performing** (PLAN 10.1, Perform). The engine plays live (Engine::setLive): the perform module's mutes, master
 * filter and echo throw act, and the mixer is in a track's path, so the isolator kills work on a single track too. MIDI
 * reaches them: the keys from middle C up (C to F#) toggle the mutes of kick, sub, hats, perc, ping, bass and pads; the
 * controller 74 (brightness) moves the master filter, the expression pedal the throw (the same in every generator); any controller can be learned for any parameter
 * (learn()). The bindings are part of the state.
 *
 * **Cues** (PLAN 10.3, Cue.h): with cue.enabled the beats, bars, blocks, operations and keys go out as OSC over UDP to
 * `TOT_CUE_HOST` (default this machine) at cue.port, each at the moment it is heard.
 *
 * **Undo** (01.10.2026, the frame): a knob turned on the panel, a preset, a new seed, a reroll, a loaded set or a choice of
 * track or mix is a step (frame::UndoHistory); a step holds only what it changed, so taking it back never takes back the
 * sounds the engine wrote on the knobs since. Knobs moved from MIDI or by a host's automation are not steps.
 *
 * **The headset** (01.10.2026, the frame): the hands of the Quest app in bridge mode arrive as OSC (frame::Headset) while
 * the settings do not say Off: left pinch play and stop, both hands the next track, right pinch the kick out and in, the
 * left hand's height the master filter, the right hand's the echo throw.
 *
 * **Mute** (after Phosphene). The output can be muted: silence at the very end of processBlock, after the meters and the
 * test recording have read the block. `TOT_MUTE=1` -- and the screenshot mode `TOT_SHOT` -- start the plugin muted, and
 * then it never unmutes itself: an automated run makes no sound.
 *
 * @note After Ephemeris' Plugin/PluginProcessor.h at d047d79 (27.09.2026).
