/**
 * @file UpdateCheck.h
 * @brief Whether a newer Totality is out (26.09.2026): once a day, in the background, a question to GitHub about the
 *        latest release -- nothing is sent but the request itself, and nothing is downloaded or installed; the status
 *        row shows the version with a link to its page. The check can be switched off (the application's settings,
 *        not the project's: Totality/Totality.updates in the user's application data). One check is shared by every
 *        instance of the plugin in a host.
