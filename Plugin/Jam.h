/**
 * @file Jam.h
 * @brief The family jam (02.10.2026): one instrument leads, the others follow -- the same file in all five.
 *
 * Ableton Link already gives the family one tempo and one bar line. The jam adds the music: the leader says its key,
 * its sections with their energy, its breaks and its drops; a follower
 *  - moves its root to the leader's at its next bar line (a transposition of what it plays, by the shortest way), and
 *    takes the leader's key and mode for whatever it composes next (its key and scale settings);
 *  - lifts and lowers its intensity with the energy of the leader's section;
 *  - thins out while the leader is in a break, and comes back with the leader's drop.
 * Settings > Family jam: Off, Lead or Follow (Frame.h, Settings::JamRole); off by default.
 *
 * **On the network.** UDP multicast to 239.255.77.77:9177 (a time-to-live of one: this network only), OSC 1.0 in
 * messages of the family's own, so a visualiser on the score cues' port never sees them:
 * @code
 *   /family/hello   s s i       instrument, instance, role (0 off, 1 lead, 2 follow)     every second
 *   /family/key     s i s       instance, root pitch class, mode ("Aeolian", "JI Minor")  on a change, and every 2 s
 *   /family/section s s f i i   instance, kind (Intro Groove Build Drop Break Outro), energy 0..1, drop, shared bar
 * @endcode
 * The shared bar is the bar of Ableton Link's timeline (the standalone) or of the host's play position (in a DAW):
 * the one bar line the instruments have in common, so a follower acts on exactly the bar the leader means. Without one
 * (-1) it acts when the message arrives.
 *
 * **Threads.** The audio thread posts (lead) and reads (follow) through wait-free rings and atomics; the bus's own
 * thread owns the socket, sends what was posted and decodes what arrives. Nothing here allocates or locks on the
 * audio thread, and a network that is down only means that nobody is heard.
