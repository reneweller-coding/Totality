/**
 * @file PluginEditor.h
 * @brief The plugin's panel (PLAN 10.1): the track or set on top, the instrument in tabs below.
 *
 * Top, the shared frame's header (Frame.h, 01.10.2026): style, key, scale, a single track or a DJ mix (a set) and its
 * length, compose, a new seed, play, mute; the ratings, the status and the rerolls, then undo, redo, help and the
 * settings; the arrange strip -- a set's tracks on their decks, a track's blocks, a lane per group of layers lit where
 * it plays, the playhead, click to jump, the wheel to zoom. Below, the tabs of PLAN
 * 10.1: Set, Arrange, Patterns (the Eclipse view), Low End, Drums, Tones, Dub, Mixer, Perform, Export, Style. The
 * parameter pages are generated from the parameter tables (EditorTheme.h, layoutOf), so a parameter that exists is on
 * the panel without anyone writing it there.
 *
 * `TOT_SHOT` (a PNG file) and `TOT_TAB` (a tab index) render the panel into a picture after the first score is composed
 * and quit the standalone -- how the layout is checked without a person looking. `TOT_SHOT_SIZE` ("1600x1000") the
 * window's size, `TOT_SHOT_AT` (a beat) jumps there first; with `TOT_PLAY` set, the meters then show that place.
 * `TOT_SHOT_ZOOM` ("from:to", beats) zooms the Arrange tab's view to that window.
 *
 * @note After Ephemeris' Plugin/PluginEditor.h at d047d79 (27.09.2026).
